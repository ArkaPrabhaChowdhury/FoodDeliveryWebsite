    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>We are 4 college students with a shared vision to start a global homemade food delivery
        service. One-day Kashish and Saksham tried something new by cooking their
        own food and shared it with their friends, all of them enjoyed it very much and then a thought 
        came to their mind that a lot of students might be facing the same problem, so they shared the food with everyone
        in their pg and recieved great responses. Then they expanded it and they got a really
        big database of consumers who want to have good and healthy homemade meal.
